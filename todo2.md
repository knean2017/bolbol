# Bolbol Project - Simple Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Current Status
✅ **Core functionality is working and impressive!**

### 🏗️ **Solid Architecture Foundation**
- ✅ **Modern Django 5.2.5** with REST Framework 3.16.1
- ✅ **Custom User Model** with phone-based authentication
- ✅ **JWT + OTP System** with refresh tokens and Redis caching
- ✅ **Modular App Structure** (users, products, interactions)
- ✅ **Professional Admin Interface** with analytics and visual indicators

### 🔧 **Technical Stack Excellence**
- ✅ **Redis Integration** for caching and message broker
- ✅ **Celery Background Tasks** for email notifications
- ✅ **PostgreSQL Support** via Docker setup
- ✅ **API Documentation** with Swagger/OpenAPI
- ✅ **Docker Containerization** with multi-service setup

### 🎨 **Feature Completeness**
- ✅ **User Management** - Registration, login, profile with phone verification
- ✅ **Product System** - CRUD operations with categories, cities, and detailed models
- ✅ **Store Management** - Business accounts with multiple phone numbers
- ✅ **Interaction Features** - Comments and bookmarking system
- ✅ **Media Handling** - Image uploads and proper file management

### 🚀 **Production Ready Elements**
- ✅ **Security** - JWT authentication, phone verification, proper middleware
- ✅ **Performance** - Redis caching, async task processing
- ✅ **Scalability** - Docker services, database migrations, proper models
- ✅ **Monitoring** - Comprehensive admin dashboards and logging setup

## 🚨 Priority Issues to Fix

### Security & API Issues
- [ ] Fix serializer security (remove `fields = "__all__"`)
- [ ] Add proper input validation
- [ ] Fix ownership checks (users can only edit their own data)
- [ ] Add error handling for all endpoints

### Missing Features
- [ ] User profile update/delete APIs
- [ ] Product update/delete functionality  
- [ ] Complete bookmark system
- [ ] Search and filtering improvements

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### For Local Development
```bash
# Regular development
python manage.py runserver
celery -A bolbol worker --loglevel=info

# With Docker
docker-compose up --build
```

### Testing
- [ ] Write basic tests for authentication
- [ ] Test API endpoints
- [ ] Test database operations

## 🚀 Production Preparation

### Database
- [ ] Switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL in production
- [ ] Set up proper database backups

### Security
- [ ] Move secrets to environment variables
- [ ] Set DEBUG=False for production
- [ ] Configure proper ALLOWED_HOSTS

### Performance
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add proper caching strategy
- [ ] Set up monitoring

## 📝 Nice to Have (Later)

### Business Features
- [ ] Order management
- [ ] Payment integration
- [ ] Review system
- [ ] Advanced search

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Set up automated deployments

## 🎯 Next Steps (This Week)
1. Fix serializer security issues
2. Add input validation
3. Write basic tests
4. Complete missing API endpoints

## 📚 Documentation Needed
